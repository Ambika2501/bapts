        <p id="letter-content">Hiiiii my monkey my pookie my handsome ambi bF,<br><br>
            Reflecting back on this year , i just want to tell you i cannot think of a better highlight than having to call you mine 
            this year , this is "literally" the best thing that happened to me this year . Like in all honesty i never thought someone apart 
            from me could make me so happy . You stand out among all the bad things i could think of which happened to me this year(like how 
            a sunflower stands out among all other flowers)
            ,thats how u made me feel !!!
            i have forgotten my bad days when i'm with you and you made me feel like HOME in such a short span.
            You make me feel all kinds of things like a small child getting excited over everything and your presence brings me butterflies in a room full of people 
            making my heart pound with your goofiness
            Thank you for everything ,nothing goes unnoticed .
            i love you with all my heart .Thank you for taking care of me and loving me .I cant wait to experince life and whats waiting for us this yearsxkjnkj
            (This picture remains my fav, i remember every bit of this moment+ my fav song which will always remind me of you )
            
             <br><br>
            Forever yours,<br>
            ambiiiiiiiiiiiii
